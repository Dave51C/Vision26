Here's a consideration I overlooked in 2025: don't mix resolutions. Make sure
they're all 640x480 or 800x600 or something like that. Also be aware that some
cameras may do a certain reolution but at a reduced frame rate, like 15fps. We
want a frame rate of 30fps or faster.

PICK A RESOLUTION:
=================
  1) Run this comanmd:

  v4l2-ctl --list-devices

  You'll get a list that looks like this:
  Integrated_Webcam_HD: Integrate (usb-0000:00:14.0-2):
	  /dev/video0
	  /dev/video1
	  /dev/media0

  USB 2.0 Camera: S200C (usb-0000:00:14.0-3):
	  /dev/video2
	  /dev/video3
	  /dev/media1

  We're interested in the USB Camera entry, specifically the "/dev/vidoe2" line.

  2) Run this command (note the use of "/dev/video2" from the above)

  v4l2-ctl -d /dev/video2 --list-formats-ext |\
  sed -n '/Size/{s/^.* //p}' |\
  sort -k1,1n -u 

  You'll get a list that looks like this:
  160x120
  176x144
  320x240
  352x288
  640x480
  800x600
  848x480
  1024x768
  1280x1024
  1920x1080

  We'll use 640x480

COLLECT CALIBRATION IMAGES:
==========================
  ASSUMING the webcam is video2,
  Run the program calibration_shots.py using the 648x480 resolution:

  3) python3 calibration_shots.py --width 640 --height 480 --device 2 

  A vidow stream will open and a countdown will start. After the specified
  interval a picture is taken. The countdown resets and the process repeats
  until the specified number of shots are taken.

  Be sure to get enough images of the checkerboard in different places and
  orientations.

GENERATE CAMERA MATRIX:
======================
  Run the program calibrate_from_stills.py supplying a name for the camera.
  Here, we're calling it Camera_B.

  4) python3 calibrate_from_stills.py --name Camera_B

  This will create a file named Camera_B_640x480.json. It conntains
    "mtx" - the camera's "intrinsic matrix"
    "dist" - the camera's distortion coefficients
